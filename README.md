# JPEG Encoder
![build](https://github.com/JakubOchnik/jpeg-encoder/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)
Work in progress!

## Working
- Conversion between RGB and YCbCr color spaces
- Chroma subsampling (currently works only with 4-pixel groups)

## TODO:
- Make chroma subsampling work with any number of pixels
- DCT
- Final encoding
- ... and all of that in reverse.
